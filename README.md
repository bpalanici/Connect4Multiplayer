# Connect4Multiplayer

Connect Four (also known as Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Four in a Row, Drop Four, and Gravitrips in the Soviet Union) is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)

The game connect4 implemented in C using Qt 5.11 for GUI that supports multiple games (of 2 players, 1v1) played at the same time, using a server that creates a fork child to manage every new game, once 2 players are online and waiting for the game to start. The players of a game can rewind the game to see what they moved and how the game looked move by mode.
